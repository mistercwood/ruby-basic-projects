# Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. 
# It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).

# * After k iterations, checking last k elements are redundant as they will already be sorted
# * Flag/counter for any swaps done during an iteration
# array[a], array[b] = array[b], array[a]
